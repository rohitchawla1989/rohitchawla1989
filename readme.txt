Hi My Name is Rohit Chawla and I am working with project support team.

I have taken part for Lucid codes as I want to learn more about programming and how we any of help to automate functions and solve the manual tides work.

I'm hoping to able to learn and build something useful to automate workflow and additionally I would like to understand the data science world to analyze the outputs of data.

I have learned that Data science is capable of using unused data to make it more meaningful with logics which makes me excited to learn and grow.
